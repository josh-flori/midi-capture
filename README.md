This was one of my first python projects.

This project is the realization of a life long dream and was also one of my first python projects (thus the documentation is not great). When I played piano as a kid I would hear the greatest songs in my head but I couldn't get them out because the technology didn't exist to capture them. All I ever wanted was for people to hear what I heard in my head but I couldn't and it was all trapped inside my head and it felt terrible.

Although I have had the ability to record songs on my computer using a digital piano keyboard for a couple years, it was still impossible to just sit at a regular piano, away from a computer, and record the note information of you played. The technology simply doesn't exist because a piano is not electronic in any way, it wasn't designed to record music.

But over the last several months I've been working on a system that uses video cameras to record footage of the piano as I play it. Then I use python to watch the video file, and capture the information in MIDI format, which is a digital representation of notes. This allows you to not take an audio recording, but rather to record note information, bring it into a computer, and then edit, build upon, and fine-tune what you played previously and only when you're done, create an audio recording that can be listened to. This allows you to capture the emotion of what you play spontaneously as you are creating in the moment, and then refine it later.

This has never been done before using image recognition. And although, like I said I have been able to write songs on my computer using a digital piano for a while, doing it at a real piano like this is not only a world-first but the realization of a dream I've had since I was like 10 or something. So anyway, super dope stuff. 

You can see what MIDI information looks like inside my music program here. In this format, you can edit the notes you captures previously as desired until they sound just right. https://imgur.com/a/foQME

And here's sort of what the system of cameras looks like that records the piano as I play it https://imgur.com/a/SrUVT0I
